# Codebook/explanation of dataset

## General

The table/data frame represented by the data generated by run_analysis.R is a tidy data set summarizing (an original summarization) of numerous accelerometer data points (and transforms) grouped by subject and the particular activity being performed while wearing the accelerometer.

Since each column represents output from one variable, each row represents an observation (or, in this case, grouping combination) and the table represents a logical grouping of data, the dataset is considered tidy according to Wickham's criteria.

Steps for reproducing the data are covered in the README.md file and the actual R script that generated this set (run_analysis.R) both present in this git repository.

Variables
-----------

 - Subject : the id number of one of the persons in the study group (range 1:30)
 - Activity : the activity being performed by the subject/wearer one of:
	 - WALKING
	 - WALKING UPSTAIRS
	 - WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
	 - SITTING
	 - STANDING
	 - LAYING

The following variables are identical to those from the original data set.  Note however that since this is a summarization of means by Subject and Activity the following variables are actually means of repeat observations of the record groupings with the possibility of a mean of mean or mean of standard deviations from numerous time window observations or transforms of same.  All acceleration units are in units of the gravity constant "g"
